# News-Classification-with-Gated-Neural-Nets

In this project, I implemented and compared two bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models—BiLSTM and BiGRU—for multi-class text classification on the AG News dataset. I primarily used TensorFlow and Keras for the full workflow: comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), text preprocessing (tokenization and padding), model training with Early Stopping, and comparative evaluation. The final analysis compares the models based on test accuracy and training efficiency, demonstrating the trade-offs between LSTM's complexity and GRU's speed for this sequence classification task.
